__dev_queue_xmit - transmit a buffer
 *      @skb: buffer to transmit
 *      @accel_priv: private data used for L2 forwarding offload
 *
 *      Queue a buffer for transmission to a network device. The caller must
 *      have set the device and priority and built the buffer before calling
 *      this function. The function can be called from an interrupt.
 *
 *      A negative errno code is returned on a failure. A success does not
 *      guarantee the frame will be transmitted as it may be dropped due
 *      to congestion or traffic shaping.
